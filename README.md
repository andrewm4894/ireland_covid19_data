Data pulled from [here](https://www.gov.ie/en/news/7e0924-latest-updates-on-covid-19-coronavirus/).

## Notes: 
- 'txt_...' fields are numbers scraped from regex on the text of the press release. 
- all other numbers are scraped from the html tables in the press releases. 
- there seems to be some delay of a couple of days between the tables in the press releases and the numbers in the text.
- looks like some manual process generating the press releases so things may change and break.
